# Workout Tracker - React Exercise Management App

## Project Overview
Workout Tracker is a React-based web application that allows users to create, manage, and track their workout routines. Users can search for exercises using an external API, create custom workouts, and save them locally. This project was developed as a learning experience to practice and demonstrate various React concepts and skills.

## What I Learned
Through the development of this project, I gained hands-on experience with several key React concepts and related technologies:

1. **React Components and Hooks**: I learned how to structure a React application using functional components (e.g., `WorkoutList`, `CreateWorkout`, `EditWorkout`, `ExerciseList`) and utilize React hooks for state management and side effects.

2. **State Management**: I used the `useState` hook extensively to manage local component state, such as workout data, exercise lists, and form inputs.

3. **Side Effects**: The `useEffect` hook was employed to handle side effects, like loading initial data and updating the UI based on state changes.

4. **Custom Hooks**: I created custom hooks (e.g., `useDebounce`) to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic across components.

5. **React Router**: I implemented client-side routing using React Router to navigate between different views of the application.

6. **Local Storage**: I learned how to use browser's local storage to persist workout data, allowing users to save and retrieve their workouts.

7. **API Integration**: I integrated with an external exercise database API to fetch exercise data, including search functionality and filtering options.

8. **Form Handling**: I created and managed forms for creating and editing workouts, including input validation and error handling.

9. **Conditional Rendering**: The application uses conditional rendering to display different UI elements based on the application state.

10. **CSS and Styling**: I used Tailwind CSS for styling, learning how to create responsive and visually appealing layouts with utility classes.

11. **Error Handling**: I implemented error handling for API requests and user interactions, displaying user-friendly error messages.

12. **Performance Optimization**: I used techniques like debouncing to optimize API calls and improve user experience.

13. **Git Version Control**: Throughout the project, I practiced using Git for version control and managing feature implementations.

## Features
* Search for exercises using an external API
* Filter exercises by body part, equipment, or target muscle
* Create custom workouts by adding exercises
* Edit existing workouts (add/remove exercises, change sets/reps)
* View a list of saved workouts
* Delete workouts
* Persist workout data using local storage

## Technologies Used
* React
* React Router
* Tailwind CSS
* ExerciseDB API (or similar exercise database API)
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* HTML5
* Local Storage API

## Future Improvements
* Implement user authentication to allow multiple users
* Add a calendar view for scheduling workouts
* Integrate with a backend server for data persistence
* Implement progress tracking and statistics
* Add the ability to share workouts between users

This project provided valuable experience in building a full-featured React application, from conception to implementation. It reinforced my understanding of React's core concepts and introduced me to several advanced techniques and libraries commonly used in modern web development.
